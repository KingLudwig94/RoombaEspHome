# Summary

This is a 360-degree indicator with thirteen addressable RGB LEDs.  It is WiFi enabled, powered by a WeMos D1 Mini.

The parts all snap together with no adhesives or fasteners required.  The WeMos snaps into the bottom tray, the top tray snaps on, and the lens ring snaps around the outside.  The lens holds the LED strip in place and locks the top and bottom trays together.  You can add plastic cement to make it permanent, but it isn't necessary.

I used:
* eSun PLA+ Black
* eSun PLA+ Clear

Printed at 210c on a Creality Ender 3 Pro at 0.2mm for the case, 0.12mm for the clear lense.
